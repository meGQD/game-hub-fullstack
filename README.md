## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/megqd/game-hub-fullstack.git](https://github.com/megqd/game-hub-fullstack.git)
    cd game-hub-fullstack
    ```

2.  **Create the Environment File**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Update the `.env` file with your database credentials, a Django SECRET_KEY, and your RAWG_API_key.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    This command will build the Docker images for the frontend and backend and start all the necessary services.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    The application should now be running.

    - **Frontend:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8000/api/](http://localhost:8000/api/)

4.  **One-Time Database Setup (Important)**
    After the containers are running for the first time, you need to set up the database. Open a **new terminal window** and run the following commands:

    - **Seed the Database with Games:** This command will populate the database with games from the RAWG API. This is a long-running process.
      ```bash
      docker-compose exec backend python manage.py seed_db
      ```

Your application is now fully set up and ready to use!
